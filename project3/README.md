# Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM) 

Implement SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding in a 2-dimensional world. The goal is to combine what we know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time.
